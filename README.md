**Stock Synapse** is a desktop inventory management application built with Java Swing. It provides a clean, user-friendly interface for managing product inventory and leverages the power of Google's Gemini AI to deliver intelligent sales forecasts and restocking recommendations.In biology, a synapse is a small gap at the end of a neuron that allows a signal to pass from one neuron to another. It's the point of connection where information is transmitted, allowing for communication within the nervous system.
Stock Synapse is a smart inventory management system designed to serve as the central nervous system for your stock and logistics operations, intelligently linking different pieces of data to enable seamless and informed decision-making.
## âœ¨ Features

*   **Full CRUD Operations**: Easily Add, View, Edit, and Delete products from your inventory.
*   **Persistent Storage**: Your inventory data is stored in a robust MySQL database.
*   **Responsive UI**: The application uses `SwingWorker` to perform background tasks like file I/O and API calls, ensuring the user interface remains responsive at all times.
*   **Dynamic Dashboard**: Get a quick overview of your inventory with key statistics that update in real-time.
*   **AI-Powered Forecasting**: Select any product to receive a concise sales forecast and actionable restocking advice generated by the Google Gemini API.
*   **Sortable Inventory Table**: Effortlessly sort your products by name, price, quantity, or any other attribute.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project follows a standard Gradle layout and is organized with a clear separation of concerns.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

To build and run this project, you will need:

1.  **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later**: The project is built using Java 17 features.
2.  **MySQL Server**: A running instance of MySQL database.
2.  **Google Gemini API Key**: The AI forecasting feature requires a valid API key from the Google AI Studio.

You do **not** need to install Gradle, as the project includes a Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`) that will automatically download the correct version.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stocksynapse.git
cd stocksynapse
```

### 2. Configure the API Key

The application loads the Gemini API key from a `local.properties` file. This file is intentionally not checked into version control to keep your key secure.

1.  In the root directory of the project (`stocksynapse/`), create a new file named `local.properties`.
2.  Add your Gemini API key to this file in the following format:
3.  Add your MySQL database connection details.

    ```properties
    # This file is for local configuration and should not be committed.
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE

    # Database Connection Settings
    DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/stocksynapse
    DB_USER=your_mysql_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE`, `your_mysql_username`, and `your_mysql_password` with your actual credentials.

### 3. Build and Run the Application

The included Gradle wrapper makes it easy to build and run the project from the command line.

**On Windows:**

```bash
# Build the project (this will also download dependencies)
.\gradlew.bat build

# Run the application
.\gradlew.bat run
```

**On macOS / Linux:**

```bash
# Make the wrapper executable (only needs to be done once)
chmod +x ./gradlew

# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run the application
./gradlew run
```

The first time you run the build, Gradle will download the required JDK and dependencies, which may take a few moments. After that, the application GUI will launch.
